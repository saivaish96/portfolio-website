                                <p>I am very fond of the Yelp website, and I use it almost every month to satisfy my
                                    food cravings. So, I chose to look at Yelp to locate some points of
                                    improvement for the platform based on user feedback. Sometimes, Yelp's system
                                    becomes hard to use because of its low discoverability of valuable features.

                                    Also, I felt it
                                    would be interesting to understand the level of challenge in the user flows. I was
                                    also interested in knowing what works well in the interface and what improvements
                                    could be made to improve it.

                                    ● Established in 2004, Yelp is a crowdsourced local reviews app - users can review
                                    and
                                    judge other
                                    businesses using existing users' reviews. <br>
                                    ● The local business can utilize the Yelp app to
                                    register
                                    themselves and the services
                                    they provide so that users can quickly discover and rate those businesses.<br> ● The

                                    mission is to <b>connect people
                                        with great local businesses; by doing that, they hope to improve the lives of

                            <h4>Objectives</h4>
                            ● To understand how users discover and evaluate businesses on Yelp and how they
                            use Yelp's filters, if applicable.<br>
                            ● To identify the pain points by using filters and ratings to refine search
                            results.<br>
                            ● To test the effectiveness, error tolerance, efficiency, and ease of using the search
                            and filter feature and whether the results are relevant to the user's search.<br>

                            <h4>Research Questions</h4>
                            ● What kind of search activities do participants use to find businesses? (e.g.,
                            keyword searches, filtering, tabs, etc.)<br>
                            ● How do the participants find the filter options once they fire the search?<br>
                            ● What is confusing or frustrating about the filters and rating metric within the
                            experience, if applicable?

                                ● Heuristic Evaluation is a usability inspection method that contains a set of
                                principles
                                or
                                heuristics that help unearth issues that might occur when users interact with
                                products.<br>
                                ● Justifying the problems based on set heuristics helps focus on usability, thus
                                eliminating
                                the subjectivity or bias in a usability evaluation. <br> ● Furthermore, it provides
                                quick and
                                cost-effective feedback to designers of the website. <br>● When the correct heuristic is
                                assigned
                                It can help suggest apt corrective measures to the designers for usability problems.<br>
                                ● I leveraged <b>Ben Shneiderman’s Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design </b>because it
                                is one
                                of the leading frameworks in the field of HCI.<br> ● These heuristics provided a higher
                                level
                                scope than other frameworks, and they help in focusing on the core tenets of usability
                                that can make or break the user experience.<br> </p>

                            <p>● Heuristic principles like ‘Permit easy reversal of actions’ advocate for a way of
                                handling
                                errors and design a forgiving system that allows users to undo and redo their
                                actions.<br>
                                ● Even a principle like ‘Keep users in control’ requires designers to design a
                                website
                                that
                                provides users with a strong sense of control and ensures no cognitive overload.<br>
                                ● Hence I
                                believe that Ben Shneiderman’s Eight Golden Rules is well suited for testing the
                                individual components of the website. <br> ● I also think that using this heuristic set
                                would
                                help
                                unearth many usability issues in the Yelp website.<br><br>
                                The Eight Golden Rules are as follows:<br>

                                        Let’s take a look at the profile menu of the user. They have provided two
                                        different
                                        options, which are bookmarks and collections.<br>
                                        The difference in the iconography of bookmarks compared to the previous
                                        screenshot
                                        thus producing
                                        ambiguity<br>
                                        If you see here, the bookmarks icon is something different than what we saw in
                                        the
                                        previous pages. Thus a user may experience difficulty in differentiating between
                                        the
                                        functionality and abilities of Bookmarks and Collections features. Furthermore,
                                        the
                                        inconsistent iconography may further confuse the user when they try to add
                                        business.<br>
                                    <h4>Design Suggestion</h4>
                                    ● It is greatly recommended to provide more significant differences between
                                    these
                                    two options of bookmarks and collection.<br>
                                    ● Since collections are a part of the bookmarks feature, it is better to keep
                                    them
                                    under a single tab of Bookmarks.<br>
                                    ● Inside the bookmarks tab, we could have the businesses displayed inside
                                    collections.<br>
                                    ● Design a different and more meaningful icon for the collections option<br>

                                        There might be cases when a user adds/removes businesses from the bookmarks list
                                        by
                                        mistake. Thus it is necessary to design a pop-up that allows the user to provide
                                        a
                                        confirmation whenever a bookmark is added or removed from the bookmarks
                                        list.<br>
                                        For example, when a user removes a business from the collection, a pop-up dialog
                                        must
                                        appear that allows the user to either confirm the removal or change their mind
                                        before the
                                        action is committed.<br>
                                        Thus, when removing or adding a business to the bookmark list, there is no
                                        constraint provided to the user that helps in preventing them from performing an
                                        unintended action.<br>

                                    Whenever a user adds or removes businesses from the collection, a pop-up dialog
                                    could
                                    be designed to confirm the action before committing it.<br>

                                        Suppose the scenario is that a user doesn't want to skim through the already
                                        answered
                                        questions but instead chooses to ask the question directly to the business
                                        owner.
                                        They
                                        would now select the ask a question button.
                                        This should ideally take the user to the input box where they can type in the
                                        question. In
                                        In contrast, the user is taken to a page where other users have posted questions
                                        for
                                        the
                                        business, and the ask a question input box only appears at the bottom of the
                                        page.
                                        Thus it
                                        makes the user scroll through almost 10-12 questions before providing the input
                                        box.
                                        Even though See all questions and ask a question are two different buttons with
                                        two
                                        other results, the website fails here and shows the same result for both the
                                        options.
                                        They make the users scroll through already asked questions before providing them
                                        the
                                        ask a question input box.
                                        Users don't want surprises or changes in expected behavior, and they get annoyed
                                        by the difficulty in obtaining necessary information and the website's inability
                                        to
                                        produce the desired result.
                                        When users click on the Ask a Question button, they have to scroll over all the
                                        answered questions before
                                        reaching the post a question section.<br>

                                I am very fond of the Yelp website, and I use it almost every month to satisfy my food
                                cravings. Therefore, I chose to look at Yelp to locate some points of improvement for
                                the platform based on user feedback. Sometimes, Yelp's system becomes hard to use
                                because of its low discoverability of valuable features and the ambiguity in its
                                structure.<br><br>

                                I hoped to learn how the usability evaluation method would help identify the real-time
                                problems in the business discovery flow and the filters feature. Also, it would be
                                interesting to understand the level of challenge in the user flows. I was also
                                interested in knowing what works well in the interface and what improvements could be
                                made to improve it. I was looking for information on whether the results satisfy users'
                                needs. I was looking forward to researching Yelp, applying usability evaluation
                                concepts, and producing good results.<br><br>

                                The information I collected from the research provided valuable information on
                                challenges in the existing system. Given that Yelp already has a large user base and is
                                dedicated to being a reliable peer-reviewed online directory for local businesses, the
                                study results would enhance user confidence in the Yelp app and further improve its
                                competitive advantage. Furthermore, the results and recommendations gleaned from the
                                study will enhance the app's mission, which is to connect people with great local
                                businesses.</p>

                                ● The objective was to determine how easy or challenging it is for users to discover
                                businesses on the
                                platform. <br>● I wanted to identify problems in the business discovery flow,
                                specifically the
                                search and filter

                                features. <br>● I wanted to understand how occasional and brand new users of Yelp
                                perform
                                everyday tasks
                                (essential features like discovering businesses) and at least one less common task
                                (set filters in a
                                search query or ask a question to an establishment) to test the intuitiveness of
                                advanced features. <br>● I also
                                wanted to learn how participants choose to go about their search, how they use the
                                filters, and how they
                                choose a business utilizing the rating systems.<br> ● After each task, I also wanted to
                                ask
                                the participants to rate
                                their usability and whether they could quickly complete the job. </p>

                                For this study, I focused on observing existing semi-frequent users and brand new users
                                of Yelp as I
                                believe that a new set of eyes will uncover many issues. As Yelp has a huge user base, I
                                wanted the
                                interface to appeal to those already using it, so I will also include current users
                                since it wouldn't make
                                sense to alienate existing users to woo new ones. I did not choose power users (frequent
                                users of an app)
                                as their experience would differ from an occasional user. Also, I followed the industry's best
                                practices and ran
                                my study on five users (the Nielsen Norman Group points out that a sample of 5 users can
                                uncover 85%
                                of a website's issues).<br><br>
                                Because Yelp users come from various backgrounds, I was not focusing too heavily on age
                                and gender
                                (based on the analysis of typical Yelp users (Yelp statistics, demographics, users, and
                                facts for 2021,
                                2022). As per Yelp statistics, the US has 41.9% of users between 18 and 34 years old
                                (Yelp statistics,
                                demographics, users, and facts for 2021 and 2022). Over 37% of users fall between 35 and 54
                                years old, and
                                19.9% are older than 55 (Yelp statistics, demographics, users, and facts for 2021,
                                2022). Also, 60% of
                                Yelpers have some college education (Yelp statistics, demographics, users, and facts for
                                2021, 2022; Fast
                                facts, n.d). Since most of the users of Yelp are college graduates, I also selected
                                users who have
                                completed their undergraduate studies or are pursuing higher education and are sound
                                with technology.
                                The users that I recruited had different income levels. Also, I wanted the participants
                                to perform various
                                tasks on Yelp so they might need access to an account. Thus, the test base will be
                                divided into two types:
                                One with Yelp accounts and one without. To eliminate the possibility of power users,
                                those with Yelp
                                accounts were users who had spent less than six months on the platform. Finally, for a
                                hassle-free remote
                                testing experience, I planned to test Yelp's website on desktops, not mobile devices. I
                                also recruited some
                                participants who have experience using Yelp's competitor products. Some of its
                                competitors of Yelp are
                                Google, TripAdvisor, Yahoo!, OpenTable, and Foursquare.<br><br>
                                Finally, I selected participants from Internet forums and message boards because they
                                provided a reliable
                                recruitment method for such a qualitative study. As a student researcher, I believe
                                relying on niche forums
                                and message boards to find participants is a cost-effective method as it's too hard to
                                recruit using more
                                broad or traditional methods. In my experience, recruiting strangers from the internet
                                groups would eliminate
                                any potential bias because if I had relied on my contacts (convenience sample), they
                                would have some
                                relationship with me and may be reluctant to give honest feedback. Considering this
                                the method runs a high
                                risk of sampling bias or groupthink, I prevented it by identifying the target audience
                                using screeners and
                                conducting one-to-one sessions to garner personal insights. One challenge I predicted in
                                the test session
                                was when participants tried to modify their behavior due to my presence. I avoided this
                                by building
                                rapport with my participants using effective icebreaker strategies.  </p>

                                testing as it provided more significant benefits than unmoderated testing, such as

                                and asking users for more information about their perspectives. I chose this specific

                                This will help me

                                The usability test consisted of an introduction, a series of tasks, and a short
                                interview for asking the
                                post-test questions. The participants were instructed to 'Think Aloud' and share their
                                thoughts throughout
                                the test. Following the task series, I gathered the users' responses and asked
                                additional questions about
                                their experience with Yelp. The test concluded with an opportunity for further,
                                open-ended comments on
                                Yelp's usability and the administered test in the form of post-test questions, which
                                provided additional
                                opportunities for qualitative insight.<br><br>
                                It took users between 30 and 40 minutes to complete the usability test. I followed the

                            <p>The primary criteria for screening the participants for the usability study were as
                                follows:<br>
                                ● Never or seldom-used Yelp, or were relatively new users of Yelp (less than three
                                months)<br>
                                ● Experience with online video chatting tools and web browsers<br><br>
                                As mentioned previously, due to constraints in time and resources, I recruited
                                participants for my study from internet groups and message boards. I contacted members
                                of the social media platform or internet group and asked for permission from the
                                group's moderator in advance. I gained initial consent, then shared the screener survey
                                in the google forms format through the same social networking site. The final version of
                                the screener survey is available below.<br><br>

                                <b>Participants’ Screener Survey for Yelp Usability Test</b><br>
                                Established in 2004, Yelp is a crowdsourced local reviews app - users can review and
                                judge other businesses using existing users' reviews. Furthermore, users can also find
                                events and use the interface to talk to other ''Yelpers.''
                                In this study, I am trying to understand the user experience of Yelp's website and if
                                Yelp's mission and values are easy for non-business users to understand, and the
                                entire customer experience is hassle-free. I am looking for participants who wish to
                                participate in this usability study and share their feedback. Please fill out the
                                screening survey below (it takes about 5 minutes), and I will send you details about the
                                1-hour remote video usability testing session upon selection. The participants in this
                                study will be accessing Yelp from its website.
                                I appreciate your interest in the survey. Though I will not compensate you for your
                                contribution, I greatly appreciate your time and response. Please note that all the
                                answers to the below questions will remain confidential.

                    </div>
                    <p>While I was waiting for the participants to fill out their availability information, I prepared
                        the
                        usability test script for the test session.<br><br>
                        The test objective was to measure the following:<br>
                        ● Can the participants correctly enter the search criteria in the correct fields?<br>
                        ● Once they find the initial search results, can the participants refine them further using the
                        available filters?<br>
                        ● Can they edit the search criteria and filter fields to acquire the targeted results when they
                        cannot
                        find the apt search results?<br>
                        ● Can the user understand the critical information on the business information page upon finding
                        the
                        targeted results? Are they able to scan reviews and learn more about the business?<br>
                        ● Can the users quickly identify and use other advanced features like saving favorite
                        restaurants,
                        posting reviews and photos, etc.?<br><br>
                        The consent form was provided to each participant before the test, clarifying their roles,
                        responsibilities, and rights. The usability tests were held between June 30th and July 4th, with
                        five participants in total. The test scenarios and post-test questionnaires below offer
                        quantitative
                        and qualitative insights into how well participants understand Yelp's tools.<br><br>

                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    Hello, and welcome to the Yelp usability test session. Thank you for your participation. This
                    usability test session aims to determine how easy or challenging it is to find information about
                    businesses on the Yelp platform.<br><br>

                    <h4>Reiterating participants' rights and privacy</h4>
                    Your participation in this test is voluntary, and you are allowed to leave at any time. The
                    responses and results from the session will be confidential. You have provided consent to
                    participate in this study and to record the session for our analysis.<br><br>

                    <h4>Clarifying the role of the participant</h4>
                    I will ask you to complete a series of tasks online using the Yelp website and record your
                    responses. Upon completing each task, I will ask you to rate the difficulty level. You must think
                    out loud when you are performing the tasks so that I understand how you are performing. I may
                    sometimes stop and ask you to elaborate on specific actions for better understanding.<br><br>

                    <h4>Ice Breaker</h4>
                    How outdoorsy are you as a person?<br>
                    What is your favorite outdoor activity?<br>
                    If you want to explore any new place, how would you go about finding it?<br>
                    Do you use any online platforms for searching for new places in the area? If so, which ones?<br><br>

                    <h4>Tasks</h4>
                    Today we will use Yelp.com, an online tool for finding businesses in your area. I will ask you to
                    complete a set of tasks on the site to understand better how you experience the website. Please try
                    to think out loud as much as possible and share with me what is going on in your mind.<br><br>
                    The task list is as follows:<br>
                    1. Imagine that it's your friend's birthday. Search for a potential restaurant [Open 6 PM current
                    night | Serves Chinese | Around $20/person | Near the Prince George Plaza, MD | Has five stars]<br>
                    2. Filter restaurants with a happy hour for alcohol, free Wi-Fi, and suitable for children.<br>
                    3. Save one restaurant for later while continuing to look at restaurants.<br>
                    4. Now that you selected a restaurant. Find how you can share this business information with your
                    friends.<br>
                    5. You get to the restaurant, and the waiter lets you know that the business offers 10% off on the
                    total order if you check in on Yelp. Find out how you can do this on Yelp.<br>
                    6. Your food arrives, and you think it's an excellent presentation. Next, identify where you would
                    post the photo on Yelp.<br>
                    7. You don't have big plans for the weekend, but you are looking for something to do with your
                    friends. You want to check out the local happenings (like a concert, play, or any other event) on
                    Yelp. Perform a search to see if any events are happening near you on Yelp over the weekend.<br>
                    8. You are returning home after vacationing in Seattle, Washington. You want to share your thoughts
                    about the Chihuly Glass Museum. Identify where you would write a review for this on Yelp.<br>
                    9. Imagine that you are driving through Washington, D.C, and your car makes a strange noise as you
                    are about to stop for the night. Someone recommends Capitol Hill Auto Service. Find out if the shop
                    is open at 8 PM on Wednesday.<br>
                    10. Before going to the Capitol Hill Auto Service, you want to check if they replace brake pads. Go
                    on Yelp and ask this auto service shop a question to enquire if they do this.<br><br>

                    <h4>Post-test questionnaire</h4>

                        <h4>Task Success usability metric</h4>
                        I selected the task success rate because it is straightforward. Moreover, I felt that
                        it is an essential measure of usability, as users are expected to be able to discover, filter,
                        and sort Yelp results effectively. Thus, everything else is irrelevant if the users can’t
                        accomplish the primary tasks. Therefore, I used the task success metric for this
                        purpose.<br><br>

                <p>
                    <h4>Individual Performance</h4>
                    User 1 (U1):<br>
                    In addition to restaurant reviews, Yelp can be utilized to review many other kinds of
                    businesses in different locations. Even though this particular user had prior experience
                    with the Yelp interface, they had difficulty finding places outside their default location.
                    For example, in task 9, the user could not find the Capitol Hill Autoservice shop even
                    after searching so many times because the location was set to Seattle, Washington, after
                    the previous task. This resulted in unfavorable results, and due to this, the user got
                    frustrated and could not go through the last two tasks.<br>
                    Satisfaction results:<br>
                    When asked about what aspects of the user interface could be improved, the user 
                    mentioned that they wanted many more options to be accommodated in the filters tab and
                    that the interface could be more interactive.<br><br>
                    User 2 (U2):<br>
                    This particular user did not have any difficulty completing the tasks from the list but did
                    have a few comments for the website that could improve its performance.<br>
                    Satisfaction results:<br>
                    The user liked the way Yelp functions and how it provides so many options for the user,
                    starting from restaurant discovery to auto repair. However, when they looked at the
                    interface, they felt that it had too much content displayed on a single page and that they
                    could be categorized better. They also had difficulty understanding some website symbols
                    like the $, which denotes how expensive a place is.<br><br>
                    User 3 (U3):<br>
                    Someone who did not have prior experience with Yelp performed well and could
                    complete many of the everyday tasks. However, this user had trouble with the discovery
                    process when discovering business with specific guidelines (Task 1), which would be the
                    case in reality. Many users will fire a search on Yelp with set criteria in mind. This user
                    also had trouble with Task 10, which involved asking a difficult question to find on the
                    interface.<br>
                    Satisfaction results:<br>
                    One suggestion this user had for improvement was to add more search parameters and
                    add more options in the filters tab, resulting in more relevant results.<br><br>
                    User 4 (U4):<br>
                    This user was able to complete almost all the tasks. However, similar to others, the
                    discovery process with specific guidelines was complex since not all the criteria were
                    easily found on the interface. One other issue that this user had was checking in on Yelp,
                    which is hidden in the interface.<br>
                    Satisfaction results:<br>
                    When asked about the worst experience in the interface, this user mentioned that it was
                    the menu. After analyzing the video recording, I believe that the user spent a lot of time
                    finding events happening near their area. This was because the previous task was about
                    finding restaurants. When asked to search for events, the navigation tab containing the
                    events link on the landing page is not visible on the search results page. Thus this user
                    spent a considerable amount of time searching for events, and even though they marked it
                    as complete, they did not find the right results for this task. This user has also mentioned
                    that the website could accommodate more filter options to result in a more refined search
                    and produce relevant results.<br><br>
                    User 5 (U5):<br>
                    This particular user also had difficulty with the discovery process. Unlike other users,
                    they did not try to use the filters to refine their search; instead, they visited each
                    restaurant and looked at all the details manually to refine their search according to the
                    criteria provided. Furthermore, they could also not complete the check-in task on Yelp
                    since it is tough to find on the interface.<br>
                    Satisfaction results:<br>
                    This user also suggested improving the search by providing more options for the filters.
                    They also mentioned they liked the way the website is designed and how the information
                    is organized.<br><br>
                    I utilized the task success rate, errors made by the participants, and comments to identify
                    patterns in the tasks performed. I gleaned the following insights after the analysis of the study.

                                            Some of the inexperienced Yelp users could not identify the presence of two
                                            separate
                                            search fields and correctly enter the name of the business in the first

                                            Nearly three out of five users expressed frustration and confusion when
                                            seeing
                                            sponsored search results that did not match their keyword or filter
                                            selections. One

                                            Some of the users had trouble with Task 1. Task 1 stated that they needed to
                                            find
                                            restaurants that cost 20 dollars per person. When trying to refine the
                                            search based
                                            on the cost, they failed to do it because they did not identify this option
                                            on Yelp.
                                            There is an option to select the price range on Yelp, which is designated by
                                            a $
                                            symbol. Unfortunately, many users did not understand this and failed to
                                            refine the
                                            search based on the cost criteria. The users weren't sure what the dollar
                                            signs
                                            meant because they did not even have a 'price' label. Instead, it just says
                                            Filters.
                                            Few expressed concerns about the 'relativeness' of the dollar signs. It was
                                            unclear
                                            to participants whether the dollar signs represented the overall cost of the
                                            menu or
                                            the price of the most expensive item.

                    <h2>Recommendation</h2>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Search and filters are a big part of the business discovery process that Yelp is famous for. They
                    have added a great set of filters that help users refine the search process. However, due to the
                    lack of visibility of these filters, many users failed to find them and even commented in the
                    satisfaction questions that they needed a better filtering system. So, I suggest the following changes
                    in the user interface for a better user experience.<br><br></p>
                <h4> Solution</h4>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-lg-6 mt-4 mt-lg-0">
                        <p>● There were user errors in the search bar because they did not understand the distinction
                            between
                            two
                            search boxes with different purposes. This is because of the consistent and horizontal look
                            of
                            the
                            search boxes. A simple solution is to have these two search fields with proper labels in
                            separate
                            rows with a large labeled search button. Doing so would draw attention to the fact that the
                            fields
                            are different and prompt the user to fill them out separately</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-6 mt-4 mt-lg-0">
                        <img src="assets/img/yelp/31.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br><br>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-lg-6 mt-4 mt-lg-0">
                        <p>● The entire price filters must be labeled as 'Price Filters', and each symbol like $, $$,
                            $$$,
                            and
                            $$$$ must have a description indicating the price range they denote. Additionally, an
                            absolute
                            price
                            range for food would be appropriate instead of just dollar signs. To eliminate any confusion
                            regarding the relative affordability of a restaurant, it would be beneficial to offer an
                            option
                            like
                            "Entrée $10-$15".</p>

                    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                    <p>Yelp was not very hard for the participants to use, but some minor quirks made the user's
                        experience more complex than expected. Improvements to the site include a robust
                        filtering system where the users can search by stars, adjust the search based on their
                        contextual location, etc.
                        I learned that the usability evaluation method helps in identifying more real-time
                        problems. In contrast, the heuristic evaluation method helps detect minor issues impacting the website's user experience. The usability evaluation testing results
                        helped in understanding the significance of redesigning the interface. The content will be
                        a lot easier to understand than the current website. For example, making dollar signs
                        represent price ranges will make the new design accessible and inclusive for everyone.
                        Throughout the usability testing of Yelp, I learned what worked well and 
                        could be improved. I successfully took on a challenge, researched it, applied the concepts
                        learned in usability evaluation and produced good results. Initially overwhelmed
                        by the challenge, I relied on user research to guide my findings. I feel that I
                        successfully utilized the HCI knowledge I have gained so far and utilized it properly
                        in the process I followed.</p>
