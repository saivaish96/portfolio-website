                        <p>
                            In this project, I have partnered with kids from 7 - 13 years of age to devise solutions
                            that will help them learn and apply computational thinking to everyday life. I interviewed kids to understand the challenges in the current learning methods of
                            computational thinking.
                            <br>
                        <h4>Challenges</h4>
                        ● The biggest challenge is that many students haven't been exposed to computational thinking
                        early, causing difficulty understanding its concepts. Furthermore, computational thinking
                        is a mental process, so they find it difficult to adapt.<br>
                        ● The second biggest challenge is that many
                        students cannot connect CT to everyday life since they have been trained to
                        memorize concepts just for good grades.<br>
                        <br>
                        <h4>How Might We Questions</h4>
                        The following questions guided my work: <br>
                        1. How might we develop a computational way of thinking in youth? <br>
                        2. How might we help youth connect computational thinking concepts to real-life situations? <br>
                        3. How might we build a learning platform that explains CT concepts more straightforwardly and
                        is suitable for youth from an early age? <br>
                        4. How might we create a space that promotes the learning of CT concepts through collaboration?
                        <br><br>
                        Together with my design partners (kids aged 7 - 13 years), I designed solutions to overcome the
                        above challenges and create spaces that help them understand CT concepts and apply the learning
                        to real-world scenarios through collaborative learning.

                <p>This study aimed to utilize the video interviewing technique to interact with youth about their
                    experience learning computational thinking concepts in school. In doing so, we sought to
                    explore youth's methods to learn computational thinking concepts. At the same time, the

                            I took on the role of the researcher and undertook the interviews. Each lasted approximately
                            twenty minutes to thirty minutes
                            and was conducted online using video conferencing. Guidelines for the interview
                            were developed, focusing mainly on two themes (in addition to a set of background
                            questions):<br>
                            ● Didactic practices and strategies employed when teaching computational thinking concepts,
                            including focusing on the tools and approach used.<br>
                            ● To affirm if children should be introduced to CT concepts at an early age<br>
                            The interviews were recorded with the interviewees' consent and were later fully
                            transcribed. Please find the interview guide below:<br>

                        <p>● Using interviews to collect data, I sought to capture “the user’s needs,
                            values,
                            and beliefs” (IDEO, 2015, p. 34). <br>
                            ● I used this method to ensure I was collecting the most
                            information possible from the participants, despite some warnings regarding interviewees
                            saying what they think the research wants to hear and doing something different than they
                            would normally say.<br>
                            ● A total of 4 participants were interviewed. Among the participants, two
                            were 20-year-olds enrolled in a STEM program. Another participant works as an engineering
                            manager for a software company, while the last participant is a 15-year-old currently
                            learning to program at school.

                        <p>
                            ● According to IDEO (p. 10, 2015), “Design Thinking begins with in-depth interviews.” <br>
                            ● To gain a clear understanding of what kids have to say about computational thinking, I
                            started my
                            interview process with two participants from the STEM program. <br>
                            ● I chose to interview
                            20-year-olds majoring in STEM fields because they must know CT concepts well in order to
                            succeed. <br>
                            ● In doing this, I hoped to understand their experience learning computational
                            thinking and how it benefited their problem-solving ability. <br>
                            ● A follow-up interview was also
                            conducted with each of them to determine how far they understood the major CT concepts
                            (Decomposition, Abstraction, Pattern recognition, and algorithmic thinking). <br>
                            ● My third
                            participant is a high school student who is enrolled in a program that includes an
                            introduction to programming, so I wanted to know about her experience. <br>
                            ● Moreover, she has
                            experience in learning with Scratch from her primary grades, which makes her a great
                            candidate. <br>
                            ● The purpose of interviewing her is to also determine whether early exposure to CT
                            concepts has benefitted her in her current course. <br>
                            ● Lastly, I chose the parent who is the
                            engineering manager of a company as my final participant. <br>
                            ● It was important for me to
                            understand how parents are involved in the learning process, and, since this person is an
                            SME, I also wanted to understand his perspective on how CT can be applied effectively in
                            real-life situations.<br><br></p>
                        <p>
                        <h4>Participant 1</h4>
                        The first participant was a 20-year-old enrolled in a STEM program. In addition to his
                        understanding of problem-solving, he was enthusiastic about the program. Because he wasn't
                        taught about CT in school, he had difficulty grasping the concepts when he enrolled in the
                        course in college. However, his understanding of CT was unclear. In his eyes, CT and coding
                        are similar.<br>

                        <h4>Participant 2</h4>
                        The second participant was a 21-year-old enrolled in a STEM program. During the program, he
                        learned how to program through game-based learning. Unfortunately, he also had similar
                        misconceptions about CT. He believed that CT could only be achieved through programming. He
                        was unaware that he had unwittingly applied concepts from CT to his coursework and
                        internships. These examples show that students have not understood the correct definition of
                        CT.<br>

                        <h4>Participant 3</h4>
                        This participant is a high school student currently studying introduction to
                        programming. She was introduced to programming in her elementary grades through Scratch's visual programming tool. She mentioned that she has difficulty recognizing
                        patterns in her current learning since getting her mind to work that way was difficult.<br>

                        <h4>Participant 4</h4>
                        This participant is a parent who works as the Engineering Manager for a company. According
                        to him, he does not have a lot of time to help his kid during his daily routine. But he
                        firmly believes that CT concepts must be taught early to help shape
                        kids' thinking. He believes that parents' involvement can help teach the concepts in a
                        simple way to children from a very early age.
                        <br><br>
                        <h4>Rationale of Data Collection Methods </h4>
                        <p>
                            ● As described previously, youth interviews were selected as the main data
                            source because they would be the quickest and more direct manner through which I could learn
                            what my participants understood about computational thinking. <br>
                            ● I chose to also interview
                            adults, even parents or teachers who might be “experts” because I wanted to understand how
                            involved the parents or teachers in the learning journey of the kids. <br>
                            ● Also, observations
                            are important because it helps negate many types of bias and much of the subjective
                            the interpretation that comes with researchers self-reporting “facts.” <br>
                            ● Basic psychology reveals
                            that people remember and relay things in different ways. <br>
                            ● This method is much better than
                            questionnaires where responses are limited to answers to predetermined questions. In this
                            method, I was able to come up with context-specific follow-up questions based on the
                            response of the participants. <br>
                            ● In the future, I would love to perform an ethnographic study
                            where I can perform a direct observation of users in their natural environment.<br>
                            ● The
                            the objective is to gain insights into how kids interact with students and parents in their
                            the natural environment and learn computational thinking concepts.

                            tools to
                            understand the challenges in the learning methods of computational thinking. These initial
                            findings
                            stem from analyses of four selected interview videos as well as field notes regarding the

                            ● Even students who are currently training to become engineers do not understand what
                            computational
                            thinking is. They have failed to realize that it is a concept that is ingrained in our
                            day-to-day
                            life. As a result, they keep getting confused between coding and problem-solving skills. The
                            approach to teaching this essential skill needs to be changed. As pointed out by the
                            interviewees,
                            we need measures to help students understand the concept and apply it to real life rather
                            than
                            memorizing it just for good grades.<br>
                            ● Further, CT skills need to be taught early in a child's life rather than starting in high
                            school.
                            Also, there is a greater focus needed on improving collaboration skills. They should not see
                            it as a
                            competition when they work with others. Instead, they should help each other in finding
                            efficient
                            solutions.

            <div class="container" data-aos="fade-up">
                <p>After the inspiration phase, in which I interviewed kids and their current learning methods of
                    computational thinking concepts, I identified two challenges.<br>
                    ● The ideation phase had two parts: <br>In the first design session, I aimed to generate ideas
                    about how
                    kids want to learn CT concepts. Based on the data collected, I created some prototypes.<br>
                    ● In the second
                    design session, I reviewed those prototypes with the kids and made changes.
                </p>
                <br>
                <div class="row">
                    <h4>Design Session 1</h4>
                    <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
                        <p>● The first design session focused on generating ideas for teaching computational thinking to
                            kids between ages 7 and 13.<br>
                            ● Because the kids were connecting from across the country, the
                            session was conducted online.<br>
                            ● The design sessions were conducted with kids aged seven years,
                            Thirteen years, 12 years, and eight years.<br>
                            ● I conducted the session via Zoom and obtained consent
                            from the parents and kids to record the session.<br>
                            ● I also provided the kids with access to
                            Jamboard, which was used during the design session.<br>
                            ● The session lasted from 50 mins to 60
                            mins.<br>
                            ● Since multiple themes emerged from the initial inspiration phase, I decided to combine
                            two to form a refined How Might We question: How might we help children connect
                            computational thinking with the real world at an early age?

                            <h6>Introduction Phase (10mins)</h6>
                            <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
                                <p>During this phase, I introduced myself to the participants and conducted some ice
                                    breaker
                                    activities. As an ice-breaker activity, I selected Show and Tell as a fun way to get
                                    children
                                    talking about their favorite possessions. Children were asked to bring a favorite
                                    stuffed animal
                                    that they bring everywhere they go so they can talk about it. I offered the older
                                    kids
                                    the
                                    option of bringing their favorite book if they did not have a toy which the
                                    13-year-old
                                    kid took
                                    up. The ice-breaker activity was influential in getting the kids to start talking
                                    without
                                    feeling
                                    shy and helped me discover their favorite things as well. It allowed me to craft a
                                    puzzle with
                                    their favorite characters in mind. To get the kids to talk about their
                                    toys, I
                                    used the
                                    the following question prompts.

                            <div class="col-lg-5 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
                                <p>During the phase, I introduced the kids to the concept of problem-solving. It
                                    consists of finding solutions to problems. A problem is a situation that needs to be
                                    changed.<br>
                                    As they worked on the puzzle, I asked them to think about the question of the day: What is your process for solving a problem that has been given to you? I provided the kids with the following
                                    puzzles and allowed them to take their time to complete the activity.<br>
                                    The kids solved the puzzles and used the Google Jamboard to reflect on
                                    their experience by writing answers on sticky notes. Some kids also sketched some of
                                    their design ideas on the jam board.

                                <p>I used the sticky notes technique for this. In this technique, I aim to evaluate
                                    the puzzle-solving activity, which would provide feedback and directions for
                                    future improvements on how I can best assist kids in learning how to solve
                                    problems (Fails et al., 2013).<br>
                                    Kids recorded their ideas or observations in each category on a separate sticky
                                    note. A parent or adult lent a helping hand for the children to express
                                    themselves.

                            <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
                                <p>I saved the Jamboard and recorded the session, which helped me review how the kids
                                    performed each activity. I collected the sticky notes and examined them for
                                    patterns that indicated what areas could be emphasized in future work. I noted 
                                    all the "Big Ideas" brought to light during the session.<br>
                                    Some of the <b>"Big Ideas"</b> that I got from the design session were:<br>
                                    1. When children are given problems or puzzles based on their favorite things, they
                                    relate to the problem much better. They love visual stimulation, and it's also
                                    helpful to have a backstory on puzzles, as it gives them the sense that they are
                                    solving a real-world problem.<br>
                                    2. The kids felt they preferred solving problems as a team rather than
                                    individually. They mentioned that the
                                    problem-solving activity would be more fun if they teamed up with friends. Another child's sketch shows how she
                                    prefers her friends to join the activity on their phones so that everyone can
                                    view the same screen simultaneously.<br>
                                    3. Another idea was to allow kids to design their puzzles so that they could both
                                    create the problem and think about various solutions, which they felt was
                                    a good strategy to improve problem-solving skills.<br>
                                    4. One of the kids had the idea of showing real-world applications after solving
                                    various puzzles so that they could relate what they learned.

                        <p>I utilized the second design session to present kids with initial prototypes of the games I
                            designed based on the first design session. I conducted the design session with the same
                            kids who participated in my first design session. The session was 60 minutes long, and three
                            kids aged 7-14 participated.
                            <br>

                            <h6>Introduction Phase (10mins)</h6>
                            <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
                                <p>● I eliminated the introduction activity since I had the same set of kids, and we had
                                    introduced ourselves in session 1. <br>
                                    ● As an alternative, I chose to talk to them about
                                    their day before we began. I began the session by posing the question of the day,
                                    "Would you prefer to play a given game or design your own?". <br>
                                    ● As discussed in Beth
                                    Bonsignore's lecture (ELMS, Module 5, Lecture) and the resources provided in it
                                    (Fails et al., 2012; Poole & Peyton, 2013 in ELMS, Module 5, Lecture), the question of the day helps to transition the kids from the introduction phase of the session into the design phase. <br>
                                    ● The goal is to introduce the kids to the session's main idea
                                    before jumping right into it. <br>
                                    ● The children had a different set of answers. A few
                                    felt that designing their own game would make them masters and allow them to use
                                    their imagination to develop interesting games.<br>
                                    ● On the other hand, some
                                    kids felt they preferred to play games designed by others because they had no
                                    experience designing games.<br>
                                    ● A few kids said they would be open to it if
                                    they were provided with an instruction sheet or template to get them started.

                                <p>● Storyboarding (Fails, Guha & Druin, 2013) was used to present a digital mockup of
                                    the
                                    game prototypes to the children. <br>
                                    ● I showed them the mockup on the Google Jamboard
                                    and
                                    made sure that they had access to the link in the meeting. <br>
                                    ● In addition, I used
                                    Comicboarding since the 7-year-old had difficulty using the mouse to draw and
                                    instead described his ideas for me to illustrate (Fails et al., 2013).<br>
                                    ● So using

                                    method, the kids reviewed the existing sketches and illustrated their suggestions.

                                <p>● I used the sticky notes technique to pose questions about the different features of
                                    the designs to the kids, which, according to Subramaniam (2016), is a
                                    straightforward process for youth to partake in.<br>
                                    ● The sticky notes technique
                                    complemented the previous storyboarding approach because the sticky notes helped the
                                    kids talk about their likes and dislikes and draw their design ideas.<br>
                                    ● The
                                    children
                                    were asked to use separate sticky notes for each idea (Subramaniam, 2016).
                                    <br>
                                    ● Sticky
                                    notes seemed like the best strategy to me because I wanted the children to stay
                                    organized and provide informative feedback on the mockups I presented, and it is an
                                    an excellent strategy for participants to reflect on (Knudtzon et al., 2003).

                                <p>I saved the Jamboard and recorded the session, which helped me review how the kids
                                    performed each activity. After gathering the sticky notes, I examined them to
                                    identify all the "Big Ideas" and make those changes in the mockups.

                    <h2>Design Solutions</h2>

                </div>
                <p>● I found that the children were most interested in game-based
                    learning methods after my design sessions with them. <br>
                    ● Also, if this were taught in an academic
                    setting, they would treat it as if it were schoolwork and do it out of obligation. <br>
                    ● When I realized
                    this, I modified my approach and decided to design something that makes learning CT fun.<br>
                    ● Based on
                    interviews, children said that learning is not fun, but it could be if they could play a game.<br>
                    ● The
                    reason why games are so popular with kids is because they are used constantly. <br>
                    It can also be
                    controlled or managed by adults and includes a learning experience.
                    <br><br>
                    ● My design for game-based learning consisted of two different solutions. <br>
                    The first solution requires
                    that students access it via technology.<br>
                    ● My goal was to make the solutions universal and accessible
                    to everyone. <br>
                    ● Taking into account the negative impacts of technology and the limited availability of
                    technology in remote areas, I have devised the second solution.<br>
                    ● In the second solution, I devised a design that can be played anywhere without any technology involvement.

                        <p>● The arcade game utilizes the game-based learning approach predominantly.<br>
                            ● The focus of game-based
                            learning is not only about designing games for students to play but to designing activities that help
                            students learn by incrementally introducing ideas and gradually moving them toward their
                            goals (Pho
                            et al., 2015).<br>
                            ● This learning app shows a list of games that introduces various concepts of
                            computational thinking. Before the kids start playing the puzzle-type games, they are
                            prompted to
                            generate their plan of problem-solving, which is an essential step in
                            problem-solving.<br>
                            ● Upon
                            successful completion of the game, they learn about the concepts they employed through a
                            visual
                            learning approach.<br>
                            ● Visual learning is a style that utilizes visual tools, such as images, graphics,
                            colors, and maps so that students can comprehend ideas and thoughts effectively.<br>
                            ● This app can be used in
                            a collaborative setting where kids connect with their friends to solve puzzles. <br>
                            ● In the end, they
                            learn about where the concept will be used in the real world, which will prompt them to have
                            structured, useful conversations.

                        <p>● This app would contain a variety of problem-solving games that would help kids master
                            different
                            concepts of computational thinking. This app would contain games for different age groups.
                            <br>
                            ● Game-based learning appealed to me because the kids mentioned most of what they learn at
                            school is
                            theoretical, and they always get excited when they learn through games because it is fun.
                            <br>
                            ● I also
                            learned that it is important to customize game-based learning activities based on kids' age
                            and
                            interests. <br>
                            ● Based on the children's interests in the show and tell activity, I customized the puzzles
                            in the design session. For instance, a girl brought her stuffed dolphin animal and shared
                            
                            that animals are her favorite thing. <br>
                            ● In the puzzle-solving phase, I provided a dog jigsaw puzzle. <br>
                            ● This triggered an incredibly positive response from the kid. <br>
                            ● All the kids confirmed that they love
                            activities that include their favorite things. <br>
                            ● This idea is used in the app where kids add
                            information about their likes, which will be used to customize puzzles.<br>
                            ● To teach kids first to create a plan of how they are going to solve problems before
                            starting the
                            game, the first step before they begin the game would be to have them write down their plan.
                            <br>
                            ● Once
                            they complete the activity; they will be provided with the outcomes of the learning, and
                            they will
                            also, be shown sketches of where this concept will be applied in real life (visual
                            learning).<br>

                            ● The mock-ups were created after the first design session.<br>

                            ● Children wanted the game to provide the ability to compete with their friends and earn
                            coins. <br>
                            ● Kids wanted easy access to their favorite games.<br>
                            ● They also wanted an option to chat with friends from the app.<br>

                                small sizes and works great when printed in oversized letters. It’s a well-known and
                                modern font that is being used increasingly on mobile apps and websites. Because of

                            <p>
                                As I started to create app screens and illustrations prototypes, I wanted to
                                research how I could use color to design effectively for children.
                                My target audience for my app is children of primary school age, particularly
                                9–13-year-olds. I remember being taught in year 2 of uni about how color is an
                                essential factor in the design of any product, as it conveys a particular emotion
                                and can therefore influence or motivate the user.
                                I decided to look into using color when designing for children. Throughout my app, I
                                will be using illustrations to assist with learning. This is where I can use color
                                to keep it interesting.
                                I wanted to choose a combination of cool and warmer colors for this project. I chose
                                green as the primary color because it brings in a sense of calmness and comfort.
                                It is associated with meanings of growth, relaxation, harmony, and freshness. Yellow
                                is associated with joy, energy, happiness, confidence, positivity,
                                light, and warmth. It’s popular in designs for children. I used
                                colors like yellow and pink to bring cheerfulness and balance to the app. Since they
                                are bright colors, choosing them as secondary colors prevents them from being too
                                distracting.

                        <p>
                            ● This design solution is specifically designed for students who don't have technology
                            access
                            and for parents who wish to cut down the computer time for their kids. <br>
                            ● This solution is a
                            fun learning experience without technology. <br>
                            ● Kids do not need to use technology whenever
                            they learn CT. <br>
                            ● I call this method Unplugged CT because it enables kids to learn
                            concepts without using a computer. <br>
                            ● Kids can play this game with their imaginations and various craft materials. <br>
                            ● During these activities, CT skills, attitudes, and approaches
                            are naturally discussed and remembered. <br>
                            ● Taking inspiration from creating your puzzles,
                            this idea is about giving the kids the supplies they need to design their 
                            games. <br>
                            ● Children can learn how to design, work in teams, and think critically by creating a
                            board game. <br>
                            ● The game begins with the first dice roll. Depending on the number on the dice,
                            that player must provide one idea for the game. <br>
                            ● Every time a dice is thrown, each player
                            must build upon the existing idea. The children can use the art supplies to explain their
                            ideas more visually. <br>
                            ● In the end, they could make their prototype from art
                            materials or digitize the design using online tools.

                        <p>
                            ● As part of the first session of design, one of the kids shared an experience from one of
                            their classes where they had to create their puzzle, and the teacher rated the activity
                            as she solved the puzzle. <br>
                            ● Inspired, I devised a solution that would give kids the
                            opportunity to learn and play without using any technology.
                            <br><br>
                            The following was the initial idea of the game developed after the first design session:<br>
                        <h6>Materials</h6>
                        ● Roll of paper — wrapping paper<br>
                        ● Construction paper<br>
                        ● Scissors<br>
                        ● Tape<br>
                        ● Glue<br>
                        ● Markers or pens<br>
                        ● Die<br>
                        ● Game pieces, such as pieces repurposed from another board game, coins, small toys, etc.

                        <h6> <br>Directions</h6>
                        ● This game is best played in teams of at least six players. <br>
                        ● The game begins with the first
                        dice roll. <br>
                        ● Depending on the number on the dice, that player must provide one idea for the
                        game. <br>
                        ● Every time a dice is thrown, each player must build upon the existing idea.<br>
                        ● By using
                        the art supplies, the children can explain their ideas more visually. <br>
                        ● In the end,
                        they could make their prototype from art materials or digitize the design using
                        online tools. <br>
                        ● Using this technique, kids can create a fun "Make your own board
                        game" activity.

                            ● They wanted
                            the DYO (Design Your Own) board game to be played like a board game with their friends so
                            that they have a set of instructions or a guide that they can utilize to have structured
                            conversations and make their games. <br>
                            ● They wanted the board game to be made colorful so

                    <p>A way of thinking takes a lot of time to develop. For future professionals to fully master and use CT, it is crucial to introduce CT concepts to kids early.
                        I want to perform more user testing with kids to make the learning activities fun and engaging for them.
                        I have made sure to design solutions that are universal and accessible to kids coming from different backgrounds, and this is something I want to evaluate during my usability testing.
                        One thing that I would like to improve on after this project is to estimate more time for recruiting participants.</p>
